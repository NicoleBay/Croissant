    <h2>A blast in the oven makes all the difference</h2>
    <p>
      Baking frozen croissants is very easy if you know how. To do this, the
      first thing you need to do is take them out of the box and place them on
      the tray. It is advisable to place about twelve per tray and leave a
      reasonable distance between each one. Then, leave them to defrost for
      about 15 minutes, enough time for them to be ready to be put in the oven,
      which you can preheat to 180 degrees for about 5 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first trick to making frozen croissants look even better is to brush
      them with beaten egg before they go in the oven. To do this, simply beat
      an egg and use a brush to coat the surface. This simple gesture will bring
      out the croissant‚Äôs natural colour.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then bake in the oven for about 15 minutes. Halfway through the baking,
      turn them over to make sure they‚Äôre perfect, then take them out to cool
      for about 5 minutes, even if it‚Äôs hard to resist those croissants when
      they‚Äôre fresh out the oven.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now comes the fun part: decorating to taste. On tip is to brush the
      croissants with syrup to give them more of a shine and to make them more
      eye-catching. And if you really want them to stand out, you can use less
      common croissants, such as multi-cereal croissants with butter and
      chocolate cream; and chocolate chip croissants with butter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whatever type of croissant you choose for your bakery or caf√©, they‚Äôre
      sure to win over your customers with their taste and texture. As well as
      filling your establishment with an irresistible aroma. Bon app√©tit!
